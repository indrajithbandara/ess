## The only bed and breakfast in Bali with its own skatepark!

Consisting of 4 different types of traditional wooden chalets, a swimming pool, a dining/lounge area, and one of the most fun skateboarding bowls in Indonesia. [Located 10 minutes from Sanur]({{site.ggogle.maps}}) east coast beaches, in the old gardens of the Kesiman Royal Family.

We designed it all ourselves in harmony with it’s peaceful green environment. The traditional atmosphere still fills the air today, with only the sound of birds and breeze blowing through the trees. It’s a very special place.

For nearly 10 years, we had let anyone ride the bowl 4 days a week for free. Those days were good, we saw many good sessions and parties happen here… a whole local skate scene was founded around our bowl.

Back then, there was no facility for the public, like bathroom and cold beer, so we decided to make it a one of a kind type of homestay with a restaurant and fast and free WiFi available in all areas. A place where you can Eat Sleep and Skate.

Nowadays, the skatepark is open to public on weekends from 4pm to 10pm. It is reserved to our guest for the rest of the time.
